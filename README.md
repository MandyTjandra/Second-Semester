# A Simple Hardware Interface Using QEMU on Ubuntu

This repository contains the only project I worked on during my **second semester** as an Informatics Engineering student. The project is titled **"A Simple Hardware Interface Using QEMU on Ubuntu"**.

## 📌 About the Project

The goal of this project is to build a minimal operating system environment and simulate basic hardware interaction using **QEMU** — a powerful open-source emulator — on an **Ubuntu** system.

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Compile a custom Linux kernel
- Set up a basic file system structure (bin, dev, proc, etc.)
- Create multiple users and manage permissions
- Build a bootable ISO image of the operating system
- Simulate terminal behavior, login systems, and ASCII art banners
- Emulate and test everything using QEMU without needing real hardware

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- QEMU
- Ubuntu Linux
- BusyBox
- GRUB
- CPIO & gzip
- Bash scripting
- Linux kernel (custom build)

## 💾 Prerequisite Files

## 💡 What I Learned
This project helped me understand how low-level systems work, including:
- Boot processes
- File system layouts
- User/group management
- System initialization and login handling
- Virtual hardware configuration

## 📁 Status
✅ Completed  
📅 Developed during Semester 2

Feel free to explore the repository to see how a simple operating system can be built and run virtually using QEMU.
